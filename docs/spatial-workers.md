# Spatial support for Cloudflare Workers

The `@ducklings/workers-spatial` package statically links DuckDB spatial, Parquet, and httpfs with GEOS and PROJ. GDAL readers such as `ST_Read` and the lakehouse extensions are omitted by default. The package is private and is not published to npm.

## Build

Use Node.js 22+, pnpm, CMake, Python/uv, and Emscripten **4.0.22**. Initialize the pinned submodules, activate the SDK, and put its `wasm-opt` on PATH:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
source /path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
export PATH="$EMSDK/upstream/bin:$PATH"
export DUCKLINGS_BUILD_JOBS=4
export VCPKG_MAX_CONCURRENCY=4
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
make duckdb-workers-spatial
make typescript-workers-spatial
make check-worker-spatial-size
pnpm --filter @ducklings/example-cloudflare-worker-spatial test
```

The build downloads/builds pinned dependencies with vcpkg, applies the checked-in patches idempotently, and writes `dist/duckdb-workers-spatial.{js,wasm}`. Incremental builds reuse `build/emscripten-spatial/`. Set `DUCKLINGS_SPATIAL_GDAL=1` only if the additional size is acceptable for your target.

## Usage

```ts
import { init, DuckDB } from '@ducklings/workers-spatial';
import wasmModule from '@ducklings/workers-spatial/wasm/duckdb-workers.wasm';

await init({ wasmModule });
const db = new DuckDB({ customConfig: { threads: '1', memory_limit: '48MB' } });
const connection = await db.connect();
try {
  const rows = await connection.query('SELECT ST_AsGeoJSON(ST_Point(1, 2)) AS geometry');
  console.log(rows);
} finally {
  await connection.close();
  await db.close();
}
```

Use `prepareAsync()` when preparing statements against remote Parquet, and close prepared statements in `finally` blocks. An Asyncify module must not execute overlapping native calls: serialize/admit work per module instance. The local example demonstrates serialized requests, not production overload handling.

## Scope and checks

- The no-GDAL build's local Worker bundle measured about 54.6 MiB; the included size check validates the configured uncompressed budget. Actual deployment limits must be checked for your account.
- Wasm linear memory is capped at 96 MiB. DuckDB's memory limit does not cover every allocation or establish total Worker memory safety.
- The native `ST_AsGeoJSON` patch copies each final string into result storage and resets temporary JSON arena allocations per row. This prevents temporary JSON trees accumulating across a vector.
- Prepared-result cleanup now destroys native results on success and failure. HTTP transport preserves supplied headers and supports the scoped headers needed by remote Parquet reads.
- The local workerd integration test covers spatial predicates, precision-reduced GeoJSON, projection, an R-tree, remote GeoParquet range reads, prepared parameters, repeated requests, and a 4,097-row/null serializer lifetime regression.

Run the integration test locally; it does not deploy. The example and package contain no application-specific routes, datasets, account credentials, or production service bindings.
